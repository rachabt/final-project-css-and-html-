      <p>Faroe Islands, Denmark
        Located in the chilly waters between Scotland and Iceland, the Faroe Islands are a real retreat. The dramatic landscapes completely redefine the notion of an ‘untouched archipelago,’ giving travelers access to a wilder side of the Danish Kingdom. </p>

      <p> The Himalayan Kingdom of Ladakh is one of the few places on Earth that remains virtually untouched and unexplored. Situated at an average altitude of 11,500 feet, Ladakh is crisscrossed by four mountain ranges, The Great Himalaya, The Ladakh, The Zanskar and The Karakoram </p>

      <p>With the renewed fervor surrounding this country and its importance in the history of the Silk Road, now is the time to head to Georgia while it’s still very ‘in the know.’ Underneath the surface of this mostly rural country lies a unique European culture most travelers have little knowledge of, where hospitality and warmth shine as travelers and guests are considered ‘gifts from God’. . </p>

      <img src=" jordan.jpg" alhe t="Image 2">
      <p> The dramatic and desolate desert landscapes of Jordan have enticed explorers to trek through its unforgiving landscapes for millennia. But what most travelers don’t know is that it’s more accessible than you might think; unlock the area’s hidden gems and Bedouin culture via Wadi Rum, a must on every intrepid traveler’s bucket list. . </p>

      <p> Located east of Stockholm, the Stockholm Archipelago is the discreet spot where Sweden’s well-heeled flock for the summer. Known by locals as skärgården, setting sail is the best way to see all of the skerries and rocks in this Swedish gem. </p>
